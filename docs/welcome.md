# rex

docusaurus based README docs generator.  
seperate your readme to different pages using `<!-- {json metadata} -->`.  
see this README in edit mode.

# use JSON

use HTML comments with json to structure your doces.  
For example:
`<!-- { "title": "rex", "category": "About" } -->` will generate a doc with title rex and a new sidebar dropdown will be created with the name About.
